FSSFrame
========

A. About
........

This is a homework for the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning course I am
taking during my Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence at POLITEHNICA
University of Bucharest.

It allows an user devise a Frame Representation for a set of facts. Also, it
allows him to use and define actions for working with this knowledge base.
Please read the files in ``doc/`` for further details (both in ODT and PDF
formats).

It is implemented in Haskell.

B. Usage
........

Simply run ``make run`` and a REPL interpreter will start. The syntax of
commands you can use are given in ``doc/FSFrame.pdf`` or ``doc/FSFrame.odt``.
